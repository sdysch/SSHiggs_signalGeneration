# SSHiggs_signalGeneration

# First time setup
- We need to add the model to the MadGraph models directory
```
cp -r /path/to/MLRSM /path/to/MadGraph/MG5_aMC_v3_1_1/models/
```

- It should be possible to add the model to `PYTHONPATH` (see [setup.sh](setup.sh)]), but I could not get this to work yet
